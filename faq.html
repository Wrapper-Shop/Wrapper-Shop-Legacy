<h2>My mods</h2>

<h3 id="can-i-make-a-request">Can I submit a mod?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Just go to this Google Form and i'll add your mod into Wrapper Shop!</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>You MUST include a picture that is 387x218. My DM's are NOT support or help. Ask Wrapper Central. Also include a .zip file with instructions. Spamming the Google Form will result in an instant termination.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-remove-my-content">Can I remove my content?</h3>
<p>Yes you can! I'd like to have a big library of mods all in one place, but you can ask to remove your mods from here.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-update-my-content">Can I update my content?</h3>
<p>Sure! If you have to remove something or make some changes, you can update your content! Just make sure to send me a .zip file and I'll put it up here!</p>

<h3 id="stealing-mods">Someone stole my mod!</h3>
<p>If you want to report someone, then you'll have to DM me evidence that you made it.</p>

<h2>What's a termination?</h2>
<p>A termination is when you get your mods removed, and you're banned from submissions.</p>

<h2>I have another question!</h2>
<p>Then DM TotallyNormal#6449 on Discord.</p>
