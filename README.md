# What is Wrapper Shop Experimental?
Wrapper Shop Experimental is for testing new Wrapper Shop features. Each version of Wrapper Shop Experimental may include changes that will or won't make it to the normal Wrapper Shop. This is also where new mods pop up before all the changes transfer to Wrapper Shop.

## Can I make my own version of it?
Yes! It's easy!

# Why does Wrapper Shop exist?
It's designed to be an easy method of getting Wrapper or Wrapper mods.

## Gamebanana?
sounds like porn games

## Why isn't it just the GA Wrapper assets but with a bunch of mods inside?
That already exists, and what about Wrapper: Offline? (or any other LVM with access to the server/store folder) It would also be limited, as you can't download any video list themes and you're only restricted to what's there.

## But why not just fork it?
didn't think of that who cares
